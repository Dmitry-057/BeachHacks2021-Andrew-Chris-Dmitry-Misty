# BeachHacks2021-Andrew-Chris-Dmitry-Misty

Fun runner-platformer games, beach theme
The goal of the player is to try to run away from the wave as long as possible while not falling from the platforms and avoiding obstacles
It was a team effort of coders and designers who worked with Unity
Most challenges came from the technical side, mostly issues with Github and Unity. We had difficulties with necessary files constantly being uploaded to the repo, and then some issues with Unity scenes not being consistent among different devs. But it is our first hackathon so it was expected
We are proud of how in such a short amount of time, with little experience, we were able to create a minimal viable prototype.
We learned that planning is crucial, that it is essential to become familiar with tools prior to the hackathon.
We will polish out the current version and add features like the total score, music, collectibles
